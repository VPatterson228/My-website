                        <h3>Types of Bridges</h3>
                        <li>Puncheons: boardwalk-like structures, low to the ground, built in boggy areas.</li>
                        <li>Foot logs: single-stringer logs, flattened on top, built on foot-traffic only trails.</li>
                        <li>Multi-stringer bridges: wider bridges built with more than one stringer to accommodate stock
                            or cyclists. Often higher above the water, with hand rails.</li>

                        <p>
                            <li>Excavation: Prepare the area where the curb log will be installed by excavating a trench
                                along the desired edge. The trench should be wide enough to accommodate the curb log and
                                deep enough to provide stability.</li>
                            <li>Foundation: Create a sturdy foundation for the curb log by filling the trench with a
                                layer of compacted gravel or crushed stone. This helps to support the curb log and
                                prevent shifting or settling over time.
                            </li>
                            <li>Installation: Place the curb log into the trench, ensuring that it is level and aligned
                                with the desired edge. Use a level and a mallet to adjust the position of the curb log
                                as needed. If using multiple pieces of material, such as bricks or stones, stack them
                                tightly together to create a cohesive edge.
                            </li>
                            <li>Anchoring: Secure the curb log in place by backfilling the trench with soil or concrete.
                                Compact the backfill material to ensure stability and prevent moveme</li>
