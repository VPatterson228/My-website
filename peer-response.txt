1. Firstly, your home page requires you to scroll to past an image of a beautiful trail to read about the mission of the WTA, making your page content below the fold.

2.the image's width can become extremely stretched at certain resolutions and the height can become stretched at certain resolutions.

3. Lastly, when your website gets small, something that could be improved upon is changing the flex-direction of your navigation bar to a column rather than a row as they become impossible to read.

4.Something I noticed when looking at the projects page was the New Trail,, Puncheon and Brushing being a little off spacing. In big/normal resolution, the card looks correct. However when sizing it down to something similar to a mobile device, I noticed it overlaps with the card below it (I inserted a photo of the puncheon as an example).

Response:

1. I add a grid display to the sections and a flex display to the class mission. With those two thing, I was able have an image on the left and text on the right. 

3. I add media queries at Max-width of 500px to switch the nav menu from horizontal to vertical. 

2,4. (Projects Page) I could not figure out how to fix the text overlap so I redesigned this page to "fix" the issue. I add a 2 column and 5 row grid layout with the flip-box on the left and the text on the right.
